Masterstroke is intended to be customized to suit your playstyle. You can make things as hard or easy as you'd like, or turn off several features that you're not interested in using. Below you'll find information about things that can be safely customized. All of the following changes should be made in the MCMs for Masterstroke *after you have run the initial setup process for the MCMs*.

## Out-Of-Game Changes
Some changes to the list must be made in Mod Organizer 2 before launching the game.

### Skin Textures
Masterstroke includes several different skin textures that can be enabled or disabled in the left pane of MO2. Note that you must have at least one skin texture enabled or else characters will not look correct.

### Bodyslides & OBody
OBody can be safely disabled in the left pane of MO2 if you do not want NPCs to have randomized bodyslide presets. Note that if you disable OBody, you will need to generate your own Bodyslides using Bodyslide. As of the Beta, support is not provided for generating your own Bodyslides but this will change with the official release of Masterstroke.

## Difficulty & Realism

If you'd like the make the list more (or less) difficult, you'll need to tweak a few things. You can also experiment with these settings if you'd like to tweak your experience. 

### AGO

- Settings
  - Persistent Arrows: Enabled

This setting makes it so you need to manually stop and remove the arrows embedded in your character.

### Engarde
- Stamina
  - Souls-like Stamina: Enabled

This adds a mechanic where using weapons consumes stamina during combat. It makes stamina management even more important and more Souls-like.

### Milk Addict
In this MCM you can tweak various features regarding becoming addicted to milk/lactacid. You can make it so you become addicted much faster or much slower.

### Milk Mod
- Settings
  - Difficulty: Whatever you want

Changing this setting makes it so you have to get milked more (or less) to increase your Milk Maid level.

### Public Whore
The settings in this menu can make it easier or more difficult to finish being the Public Whore.

### Sets of Skills
If you opt to not pick a class using Sets of Skills, you will not receive class bonuses which can make the game harder.

### Simply Balanced
There's no correct answer here, you'll need to read through this MCM and see what settings you would like to change. With the Simply Balanced MCM you can make the game much harder or much easier. Play with the settings and see what works for you.

### Sunhelm
The survival mechanics can be tweaked to affect how frequently you need to fulfill your needs, or disabled completely.

### Toyful Temptations
In this MCM you can change how often traps that place Toys on your character occur, as well as control how frequently keys appear. Changing these settings can make the Toys experience much harder or much easier.

### Toys
In this MCM you can change the difficulty of escaping toys as well as turn off various features related to Toys, if that's what you want.

### Trade & Barter
- Barter Rates
  - Barter Preset: Whatever you want

Making this change will make items sell for more or less and increase or decrease the cost of purchasing items.

### True Armor
- Save & Load
  - Click "Load Realistic Settings"

This change makes the differences in heavy armor vs. light armor much more dramatic and realistic. This change will also make it so that you have to take into account what weapon you're using in relation to enemy armors.

### Yamete
In this MCM you can change the requirements to be defeated as well as what happens when you are defeated. It can also be disabled completely if you want to forego the defeat mechanics in the list and would instead prefer to just die.

## Content
Some content is not to everyone's tastes and can be safely disabled if you are not a fan of that content.

### Fill Her Up
In this MCM you can modify or disable the mechanics related to being filled with fluids.

### Gender Bender
While this only works with female player characters, Gender Bender can be optionally enabled or disabled if you either want or don't  want the ability to add a schlong to your character. It is recommended you leave this disabled if you do not want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character, but should be enabled if you do want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character. You can also enable futa NPCs using Gender Bender.

### Keep It Breezy
Keep It Breezy allows you to swap normal armor for its Bikini variant. It can be modified or disabled in this mod's MCM.

### Milk Addict
The addiction to milk features can be disabled in this MCM.

### Milk Mod
If you do not want to use the milk features of the list, these can be tweaked and disabled in this mod's MCM.

### Scrappies Matchmaker
The locations of where matchmaking occurs can be modified and disabled in this MCM.

### Toyful Temptations
This MCM allows for trapped containers to be disabled if you do not want these mechanics.

## Other
Various other tweaks can be applied to Masterstroke depending on your preferences.

### Quick Light
The lightsource can be modified safely to be brighter or less bright.

### Hotkeys
You should refer to the [Masterstroke Keymap](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0cd559c4d9f1a88b965b552e961a906c) before changing hotkeys, but the hotkeys can be reassigned freely.

### SmoothCam Preset
You can safely change the SmoothCam preset in this mod's MCM if you do not like the default preset. You can and should experiment to see which camera variant you like best.

## Things You Shouldn't Mess With
The following items should not be changed.

### HUD
The various widgets and HUDs are affected by a several mods and shouldn't be modified.

### SexLab
The configuration for SexLab itself is set up in such a way that things should work as smoothly as possible. Tweaking things in this MCM isn't recommended.
