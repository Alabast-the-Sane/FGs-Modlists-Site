### “A mod failed to download.”

The short answer: wait for an update to the list. The long answer is you can try to install the missing mods manually if the files are still available on the Nexus, but again, do not ask for anyone to share old files. I work a full-time job in addition to several other personal projects, of which Living Skyrim is just one. If installs are failing, I will try to update as quickly as possible but sometimes it may be a couple of days before I can get to it.

### “Wabbajack says I’m out of requests.”

Nexus Premium is limited to 2500 downloads in a given 24 hour timeframe. Usually this limit resets around 9PM Eastern Time. Wait for your limit to reset and you’ll be able to proceed. Usually this only occurs after attempting to download the list multiple times in a row or when attempting to download multiple lists in the same 24 hour window.

### “Can I pause the installation?”

Yes, just close Wabbajack. When you start the installation process again it will pick up from where it left off.

### “Can I delete the downloads folder after installing?”

Yes, but remember that if you need to update the list you will have to download all of the mods that have updated again.

### "ENB Series fails to download."

You'll need to download this manually and put it in your downloads folder. The mirror for this file can be found here: [ENB Series](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm)
